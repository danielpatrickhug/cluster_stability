# cluster_stability
Using stable diffusion models to generate images from topic clusters


### What is the purpose of this repo
- The purpose of this repository is to take unstructured text data, cluster the data(sbert, kmeans), topics modeling, and generation of images representative of the local topic clusters.

### ideas
- given a list of topics for a cluster, spherically interpolate through the text prompts and generate topic frames with stable diffusion model
- maybe generate an unsupervised news real
